# advent2023

Solutions to the Advent of Code problems for 2023. This year I'm attempting to implement the algorithms in JavaScript.

Each day's solution is in a separate file, named `dayXX.js` where `XX` is the day number. The input data is in a file named `partX.txt` along with a `sampleX.txt` file containing a sample input.

The code can be run from the command line using Node.js. For example, to run the solution for day 1, use the command:

`node day01.js`
